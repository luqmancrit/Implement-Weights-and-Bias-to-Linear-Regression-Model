## IntroductionðŸ§¬
Hi everyone! This is my first Introduction to Machine Learning exercise 'Implementation of weights and bias in linear regression model' by Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization Course 1ðŸ˜Š

This exercise has been done with a house price prediction model project mimick. 

## Objective LearningðŸ’»
1. Learn to implement weight and bias to single variable linear regression

## ConclusionðŸ”Ž
Linear regression build a model which applies the relationship between feature input and target output. Weight and bias parameters value will effects the predicted target, which either it is fit or not for the model.
